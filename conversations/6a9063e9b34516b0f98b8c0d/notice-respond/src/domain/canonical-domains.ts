/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   CANONICAL DOMAINS — the authoritative source of truth for
   every vertical/domain in the MailMyPDF ecosystem.

   A workflow's OWNER is determined by the user's underlying
   problem/domain — NOT by which engine happens to execute it.

   The engine does NOT determine the domain.
   CP2000 → notice-respond (document-action engine)
   TransUnion dispute → dispute-mail (dispute engine)
   Both use document analysis, but ownership is different.
