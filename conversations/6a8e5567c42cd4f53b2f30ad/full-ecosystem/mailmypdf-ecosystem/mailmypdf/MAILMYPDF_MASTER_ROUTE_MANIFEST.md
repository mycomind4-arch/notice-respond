# MailMyPDF Master Public Route Manifest

This manifest freezes the public information architecture for the unified `mailmypdf.ai` ecosystem.

## Placeholder behavior

Routes without an active implementation should resolve through the gateway to a product-aware placeholder page. Placeholder pages are intentionally part of the permanent IA and are not to be removed simply because implementation is deferred.

Placeholder pages must include:

- canonical page title
- H1 matching the route/product intent
- concise explanation of the intended workflow
- ecosystem navigation
- link to `/send`
- link to the relevant product family
- no false claim that the workflow is currently executable

The site owner will control search indexing at launch. During pre-launch, route completeness and navigation completeness take priority over search visibility.
