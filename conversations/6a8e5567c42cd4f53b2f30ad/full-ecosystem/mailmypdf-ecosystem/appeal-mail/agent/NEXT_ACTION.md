## Immediate Next Steps

1. Commit documentation updates
2. Push to origin/main
3. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers using existing deployment config
4. Verify deployed site:
   - Homepage loads
   - /workflows loads
   - At least one category route (/appeal/insurance) loads
   - Insurance Appeal route (/workflows/denied-claim) loads
   - At least one catalog workflow page (/appeal/ssi) loads
   - Navigation works

## After This Milestone

STOP. Do not begin implementing:
- SSI intelligence
- SSDI intelligence
- Unemployment intelligence
- Medicaid intelligence
- SNAP intelligence
- Workers comp intelligence
- VA intelligence
- New appeal engines
- Speculative orchestration

The next milestone (when explicitly requested) would be implementing the first additional appeal intelligence engine. That decision is the owner's to make.
