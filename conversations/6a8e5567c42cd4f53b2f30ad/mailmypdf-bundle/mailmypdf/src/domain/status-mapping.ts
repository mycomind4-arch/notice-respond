/**
 * Status Mapping — bridges the legacy OrderStatus enum and the new
 * MailJobStatus domain model.
 *
 * This file is the ONLY place that knows how to translate between the two.
 * Existing code continues to use OrderStatus (from the database enum);
 * new code (application services, domain logic) uses MailJobStatus.
 *
 * The mapping is many-to-one: multiple granular OrderStatus values map
 * to a single MailJobStatus. The reverse mapping picks the most
 * specific OrderStatus for a given MailJobStatus.
