/**
 * Proof-of-Service — Address Verification
 *
 * Wraps the existing Lob address validation (src/lib/address-validation.ts)
 * with proof-of-service specific concerns:
 * - Supports per-tenant Lob API keys (falls back to platform key)
 * - Returns a custody-event-compatible result
 * - Stores the verification result in the communication record's metadata
 * - Adds an "address_verified" custody event to the chain
 *
 * The verification is advisory but recorded: even if the address fails
 * verification, the send still proceeds (the sender may have knowledge
 * we don't). But the proof bundle will reflect that the address was
 * undeliverable per Lob's API — which is itself evidentially relevant.
